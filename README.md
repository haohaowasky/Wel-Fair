Wel-Fair is a Participation economy platform to empower underprivileged citizens to give back to their communities and get rewarded for their contributions.

Inspiration
The US Government spends $610B on public welfare per year, while the administrative cost can be as high as 40%. Meanwhile low-income population often struggles with employment.

What it does
Wel-fair provides a participation economy marketplace that augments existing welfare programs. In this ecosystem, local municipalities organize open contracts that are tailored towards community benefit that are traditionally undertaken by private contractors, such as park services, community security and construction projects. Individuals who qualify for social welfare can claim these jobs and complete them for “tokens” to be used for topping up existing welfare allocations.

How we built it
We built it on the Ethereum test network using Javascript with React framework. We lean heavily on Bloom ID Attestation to build profiles for eligibility verification process. We also leverage the iBeacon hardware to validate completion of projects.
